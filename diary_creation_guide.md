# Creating Your Diary Entry Pages

Since you have 10 diary entries, here's the most efficient way to create them all:

## Step 1: Create the diary folder structure

In your GitHub repository, create a folder called `diary`

## Step 2: Create each diary entry file

For each diary entry, you'll need to:

1. Copy the `diary-entry-template.html` I created
2. Replace `ENTRY_DATE` with the actual date
3. Paste the diary content from your current website

## Quick Method: Use this script

I'll create individual diary entry files for you. Here are the URLs you need to fetch from your current site:

### Diary Entry URLs to fetch:

1. **2002-07-30.html** - https://www.romascokelly.com/sample-page/our-france-diary/untitled-1/

## Option 1: I can create them all for you

Would you like me to fetch all 10 diary entries and create the complete HTML files? It will take a few minutes but you'll have everything ready to upload.

## Option 2: Do it yourself (faster)

1. Visit each URL above in your browser
2. Copy the diary content (everything between the date heading and the sidebar)
3. Use the template I created
4. Save as the filename shown above in a `diary` folder

## Which would you prefer?

Let me know and I'll either:
- A) Create all 10 diary entry HTML files for you (takes ~5 minutes)
- B) Create a simple web scraper tool you can run locally to automate this

The advantage of Option A is you'll have everything ready immediately!
