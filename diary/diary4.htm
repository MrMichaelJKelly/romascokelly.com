            stories!</p>
            <p>It's the morning of day 9 and Ev went off to school today for the first 
            time with no tears and no wailing, heart-wrenching laments of, &quot;please don't 
            make me gooooo! It's too hard...I can't do it...pleeease - just not today!&quot; 
            Yahoo!&nbsp; I've been taking the boys to school the past few days even though Mike 
            reminds me that we agreed to take turns. But, as hard as it was to watch him 
            anguish, it was harder for me not to be with him. My tummy would churn all 
            day, then usually when we went to pick him up he was a little happier. I would 
            end my evening with my new French cocktail - a glass of French champagne with 
            a pepto chaser!&nbsp; It looks like we might be&nbsp;over the hump though!
          
          <P>
          I have to tell you about the lunch at their 
            school - which is eaten in the <span lang="fr"><i>cantine</i></span>. As you 
            may remember, this has been quite a source of anxiety for the boys - 
            especially Ev. The kids have a two- hour break for lunch.&nbsp; Because about 30% of 
            the students are international students (German, Italian, British, and 
            American mostly) who don't live in the neighborhood, and because many of the 
            neighborhood kids have two parents 
            who work, most children stay at school for these two hours. I think it's well over 
            half of the kids who stay. They have an actual one-hour sit down lunch, the 
            younger (1st/2nd grade) kids first, then the older kids.&nbsp; Can 
            you imagine this in the States? I am now beginning to understand that in a 
            country where food is next to Godliness, the lunch hour is as much of an 
            educational priority as math or history. It's pretty cool - they serve several 
            courses including an appetizer, main dish, cheese course, then dessert. The 
            kids are obliged to try all the food, but in reality it depends on which 
            teacher ends up sitting at their table. For our kids, especially the younger 
            one, this is quite a challenge. We eat about 5 things - pizza, cheeseburgers, 
            pasta, fries, and an occasional oddity like fried calamari and szechuan 
            chicken. Here, they are getting foods that I've never even heard of (and 
            that's from the limited list of things that I can understand on the menu!) 
            They are getting quite yummy things too such as&nbsp;lamb shanks, roast beef, 
            <i>quenelles</i> (a specialty from Lyon that are kinda like cannelloni), filet of 
            fish with basil sauce, etc. Each day features a different type of French 
            cheese, just before dessert. And the desserts are nothing to sniff at either -
            <i>mousse au chocolat, creme dessert vanille, glace</i>, and <i>gateau de caramel</i>. <I>Pas 
            mal </I>(not bad), eh?
          <P>
            Back to the point I'm trying to make... The French are having a bit of a 
            national food crisis right now. There is a great fear that younger people are 
            not growing up with the same love of and appreciation for good, quality, 
            French food, and that they are losing the custom of the leisurely, 2 hour 
            lunch.&nbsp;Food, and the enjoyment of it, is a cultural icon.&nbsp;There is an alarming 
            trend here which is in full force in&nbsp;the U.S. -&nbsp;fast food is rampant, people 
            are always in a hurry and don't have time to prepare meals and sit down and 
            enjoy them together with friends and family, etc. The French&nbsp;live in fear that 
            this will happen to them, and rightly so if you ask me. There are currently 
            914 <a href="http://www.jeremyjosephs.com/mcdonalds.htm">McDonalds</a> in France, and they say that one million 
            French people eat at McDonalds each day. Many French see this as a national 
            shame, and a failure to resist the fast food trend. France is full of small <i>
            <span lang="fr">boucheries</span></i> (butcher shops) carrying good, quality meats and poultry, artisan
            <i> 
            <span lang="fr">boulangeries</span> </i>(with a dazzling array of breads, tartes, cream puffy things, 
            etc.) and <i>fromageries</i> (stinky cheese shops, as the boys call them) with hand 
            made cheeses from all over France. And there are outdoor markets on every 
            other street corner somewhere in the city where farmers bring their produce, 
            homemade wines, sausages, honeys and preserves to name a few goodies. Their 
            prices are higher, but the quality of what you get is very good. </font>
           <P>

           However, these smalll shops are in danger&nbsp;of what is becoming another big 
            threat to the French traditional food scene - the dreaded supermarche. Picture 
            Walmart times five and this is what you find on the outskirts of cities - much 
            like the Walmart concept in fact. These supermarches have everything from food 
            (not as high quality as the little shops)&nbsp;to cosmetics to appliances, at&nbsp;the 
            lowest prices in town,&nbsp;and they are <b>PACKED</b>! I know, because, well, uh, we've 
            been there. Or, well, actually, we go there quite often. This is because
            <ol>
              <li>We can drive and fill our car with heavy items like milk, juice, diet coke, 
            and ladders, laundry detergent, shelving, etc. These get heavy schlepping them 
            across town on foot</li>
              <li>It's the only place I can find maple syrup,&nbsp;Ritz 
            crackers,&nbsp;and microwave popcorn -&nbsp;three staples in the Romasco-Kelly household, 
            and</li>
              <li>It's all under one roof.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So I am completely aware of the seduction of 
            these supermarches which is not surprising since I am a suburban dweller at 
            heart, but what amazes and saddens me is that the French are falling for this 
            too! As lifestyles become more hectic, meals become shorter and less 
            elaborate, people look for shortcuts where they can. It's very sad. I must add 
            that now that we have our household basics, we are trying to shop locally and 
            wean ourselves away from the less expensive, terribly convenient, seductive 
            supermarches! I'll be damned if I'll be accused of adding to the French 
            national food crisis!
           <P>
            I just finished reading this great book,
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0786864656/qid=1031919352/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-2814885-5471956?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">&quot;A Goose in Toulouse&quot;</A> written by Mort 
            Rosenbloom,&nbsp;former editor of the <a href="http://www.iht.com">International Herald Tribune</a>.  He 
            went around France interviewing chefs, farmers, cheese makers, and other foodies about their perceptions of the role of food in&nbsp;France today. It is a 
            good read and has given me a better perspective on things like the 2 hour 
            lunch at school. There is a concerted effort in France to teach kids to 
            appreciate and eat good food.&nbsp; He writes about an experiment that is being 
            conducted in some elementary schools in France.&nbsp;A group of chefs has designed a 
            food appreciation course for kids that focuses on getting in touch with your 
            five 
            senses.&nbsp;Each session focuses on a different sense. For example, the session on 
            smell consists of the kids smelling several viles of spices and other scents 
            and then trying to identify them. The course ends with the kids preparing and 
            eating a traditional French meal. Pretty cool, huh?

            <p>
             We have also seen that for an outsider who&nbsp;is not yet completely in touch with 
            the wonders of French food, the adaptation can be a bit rough. Yesterday when 
            we picked the boys up from school, Kyle whispered to Mike, &quot;I threw up at 
            lunch today.&quot; &quot;Why? What happened?&quot;&nbsp;we both asked.&nbsp;The teacher made me eat all 
            my gratin de courgettes - baked zucchini. Apparently, Kyle tasted it like&nbsp;he 
            was supposed to, then&nbsp;said that he didn't want to eat any more.&nbsp;The 
            teacher&nbsp;made him eat it all, until the last bite when it all came up again. We 
            asked what she did then, and he said, &quot;she told me I didn't have to eat 
            anymore!&quot; Poor guy.&nbsp;You know me... I was all ready to go in and say, &quot;look, 
            the deal is that they try it, right? Blah, blah, blah.&quot; Then I thought, no... 
            he is big enough to fight his own battles, and the more I do it for him, the 
            less practice he has in turning into a feisty #!*#! like his mother. So there. 
            I can learn too!</p>
            <h3>The Shootout</h3>
          <p>Okay, enough about food for now. I'll bet you're wondering about the shootout, 
            right?&nbsp;Well, last Wednesday afternoon, we were hanging around in the apartment 
            with the windows open. We suddenly heard a big commotion outside on the street 
            below with&nbsp;lots of yelling. We went out to the balcony to check it out and saw 
            that there was a lot of pushing and shoving going on between&nbsp;2 guys from the 
            fruitier (the corner fruit and veggie shop) and a group of 6 kids in their 
            late teens. They were progressing down the sidewalk pushing and shoving one 
            another, while others tried to hold them back and prevent a fight. It was 
            getting rather heated and we couldn't tell what was being said but guessed 
            that the kids has stolen something, or messed with one of the displays. 
            Anyway, along comes this guy out of nowhere and starts shouting, reaches into 
            his pants and pulls out a pistol, aims it at the group of kids and fires! I 
            shouted, &quot;Mike, get out of the balcony before that nuts starts shooting up 
            here!&quot; But, unwilling to miss the action, we&nbsp;creeped back to the balcony and 
            saw the guy turn and run down the street still yelling something 
            unintelligible (to us anyway!) We looked around but didn't see anyone who 
            looked as though&nbsp;s/he&nbsp;got shot. A few minutes later the police arrived and I 
            expected people to run up to them and tell them where this crazy guy had fled 
            to, but no one paid them any attention! Hmmmm... wonder what that's about? It 
            was quite an exciting moment and made me realize that I'm not in Redmond 
            anymore either! I'm planning to go talk to the woman at the pizza shop across 
            the street to get the scoop, then I'll fill you in. We have gotten to know 
            each other a bit, since I'm there quite often. She makes a ravioli pizza that 
            is to die for!</p>  
            <img border="5" src="../images//SSCN1129.JPG" align="left" width="320" height="240" />
          <p>Well, that's all the scoop for now. Thanks to all 
            of you who have lent your kind words of support last week as we were going 
            through the first week of school. Take care, and keep in touch!</p>
