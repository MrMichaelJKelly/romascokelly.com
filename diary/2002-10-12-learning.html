    <h2>December 4, 2002</h2>
   <p class="style_bold"><span lang="fr">La Politique Française</span> (French 
    Politics)</p>
    <p>You can tell Mike is back at the updates since this month's 
    posting focuses not on great food and hiking, but politics.&nbsp; It is (or was, 
    when I <i>started </i>writing this!)&nbsp; 
    November, which means Election Day in the US. We've also gotten some email 
    from friends in the U.S. curious about French (and more generally, European) 
    reactions to the Iraq crisis, which is headline news virtually every day 
    here in France as it is in the U.S.</p>
    <p>There's also been some interesting French political 
    machinations, including a series of strikes culminating in a national 
    general strike last Tuesday, the first in seven years.</p>
    <h2>Iraq</h2>
    <p><a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2073551">This article</a> 
    from Slate captures the sense of recrimination and suspicion between the 
    U.S. and France right now over Iraq.&nbsp; And there is, I think it's fair 
    to say, wide contempt for President Bush in the French press.&nbsp; Even I 
    was surprised to read the lead editorial this week in one of France's 
    leading newsweeklies,
    <a href="http://www.lexpress.fr/Express/Edito/Dossier/edito/dossier.asp">
    L'Express</a> -- this is no left-wing rag, but more akin to the 
    <a href="http://www.newsweek.com">Newsweek</a> of France -- titled &quot;Who wants 
    peace?&quot; which starts &quot;Nothing in the record of George W. Bush since his 
    ascension to the White House reassures us.&nbsp; His ignorance of the world 
    is obvious, and his simplistic nature, evident.&quot;&nbsp; These are strong 
    words from the mainstream French press, and they aren't unusual -- another 
    mainstream newsweekly, <a href="http://www.lepoint.fr">Le Point</a>, a few weeks ago ran on its 
    <a href="../images//Bush%20in%20Le%20Point.JPG">cover</a> a not very 
    flattering picture of Bush with the title &quot;Bush: Can He Be Trusted?&quot; (It 
    should be clear what their
    <a href="http://www.lepoint.fr/monde/document.html?did=122101">answer</a> was.)&nbsp; This may help to explain why 
    France has been a leader of the opposition to U.S. action in Iraq -- simply 
    put, they don't trust Bush to do the right thing.&nbsp; In America, it seems 
    to be seen the way Bush has drawn it: either you're with us or against us, 
    and Americans can't understand why any Western country wouldn't be with 
    them.&nbsp; In France, it's seen not as being against America, but for a 
    &quot;third way&quot; that Europe is trying to find; even the editorial I mentioned 
    above goes on to say that, if it comes to war, &quot;[France] will have no choice 
    but to say to America, as de Gaulle did to Kennedy in 1962 at the time of 
    the 
    <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=761555123">Bay of Pigs</a>, 'We stand at your side.'&quot;&nbsp; But just drawing the 
    parallel to certainly one of the more embarrassing moments in recent U.S. 
    foreign policy tells a lot about the French and European skepticism about 
    the Iraq undertaking.</p>
    <p>Fundamentally, France looks at the U.S. dominance of the 
    world stage the way that many Americans look at the dot-com millionaires -- 
    a mixture of envy, admiration, resentment and a sense that they don't really 
    deserve all that they have.&nbsp; Many French intellectuals and &quot;thought 
    leaders&quot; doubtless believe that if there were any real justice in the world, 
    France would be leading, not the U.S.&nbsp; And there is a fierce sense of 
    French pride against &quot;the American way&quot; -- which to them involves 
    two things:</p>
    	</font>
		<ul>
			<li>
    <p>an overly 
    quick finger on the trigger.&nbsp; The American film &quot;<a href="http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com">Bowling 
    for Columbine</a>&quot;, which looks critically and hilariously at 
    Americans' love of guns, is getting good reviews and has been
    <a href="http://www.allianceatlantis.com/corporate/press_media/aac02_E01.asp">playing 
    very successfully in France</a> 
    since September.</p>
      	  </li>
			<li>
    <p>an over willingness to work too much (nearly everyone I talk 
    to, from local shopkeepers to the woman who cut my hair last Saturday, 
    believes that Americans don't eat lunch and work all the time, 24/7), 
    perfectly symbolized by McDonalds.&nbsp; In France, the work week is set at 
    35 hours by national law, and finding stores (or much of anything) open on 
    Sunday is a rarity.</p>
      	  </li>
		</ul>
    <p>France in short sees itself as a bulwark against the spread 
    of American influence in the world.</p>
    <h2>The Strikes</h2>
    <p>The strikes also capture an interesting difference between 
    France and the United States.&nbsp; First of all, there generally aren't 
    strikes in the U.S. and if there are, they aren't usually accompanied by 
    loud public demonstrations.&nbsp; Unions in the U.S. operate from a position 
    of weakness and generally -- the UPS strike five years ago or so is an 
    exception -- can't count on public support, especially if the public is at 
    all inconvenienced.&nbsp; In France, strikes are generally public events, 
    with large marches through the streets, and a poll I saw recently found that 
    even when inconvenienced, 2/3 of the French support the strikers.&nbsp; 
    Imagine that trucks blocked freeways leading into major US cities, demanding 
    fewer hours of driving per month -- and Americans affected by these 
    blockades <b>supporting</b> the drivers!&nbsp; But that's exactly what happened here in 
    France a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; The strikes are also taken in stride, with posters on the 
    buses announcing a few days beforehand: &quot;Because of a national strike on 
    Tuesday, schedules will be disrupted, particularly on service to the center 
    of town.&quot;&nbsp; The school sent 
    <a href="strike_by_cafeteria_workers.htm" target="_blank">this flyer</a> home advising us to 
    have the kids bring a cold lunch on that Tuesday (normally strictly 
    forbidden) since the school kitchen workers would be out on strike.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the main issue behind all the strikes is fear.&nbsp; Fear 
    for what the new conservative government's plan for &quot;decentralization&quot; of 
    many government programs will mean, fear for the solidity of retirement and 
    health care plans (both government-run in France) and fear for job security 
    as large French government-held companies (France Telecom, the French phone 
    company; La Poste, the French postal service; and SNCF, the French railroad) 
    are exposed to private competition over the next several years as part of 
    the European integration that brought the new Euro currency at the start of 
    this year.&nbsp; There's reason for this: the French post office runs 17,000 
    individual offices, 2/3 of which are not profitable.&nbsp; France Telecom 
    has 108,000 employees and just needed a $9 billion infusion of French 
    government capital to keep it solvent.&nbsp; But France is in a tough 
    position, having fallen to 30th in a
    <a href="http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Global+Competitiveness+Programme/Reports/Global+Competitiveness+Report+2002-2003">
    recent study of global economic competitiveness</a> (behind Slovenia and 
    Estonia, and just ahead of China and Tunisia), and falling either just below 
    or just above (depending on whose figures you believe) the European budget 
    deficit standards that are the basis for the common currency.&nbsp; France 
    must figure out how to operate effectively in a global competitive economy 
    while still maintaining what is special about France.&nbsp; U.S. conservatives who 
    believe that isn't possible need to explain how Finland and Sweden, both 
    countries with rich social welfare systems, ranked 2nd and 5th, 
    respectively, in this survey.&nbsp; They have figured out how to have their 
    cake and eat it, too -- the French haven't yet.&nbsp; On the other hand, 
    another <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1804092.stm">study</a> 
    finds that the French live the longest in Europe -- so maybe it's not all 
    competitiveness after all.&nbsp; But as our friend, 
    <a href="../images/En%20fait...%20(Marc).JPG">Marc</a>, who is French but 
    just returned after living for several years in the U.S. says: &quot;In the U.S., 
    I'm a Democrat because the American system isn't concerned enough with 
    equity and dividing the cake fairly.&nbsp; In France, I'm a conservative 
    because you have to <b>have</b> a cake before you can divide it, and the French 
    aren't concerned enough with producing any cake, just arguing on how to 
    divide a shrinking cake.&quot;</p>
    <h2>Personal News</h2>
    <p>Since our last update, we've been to Normandy on the kids 
    October vacation, where we saw the D-Day beaches.&nbsp; 
    We've also had some visitors -- Mike's sister, Maureen and her daughter, Lia, 
    in October and our friends, Jody and Steve with their kids, came for 
    Thanksgiving, which we had here at our house.&nbsp; It was a bit odd because 
    it was otherwise a perfectly normal Thursday in Grenoble, with all the 
    stores open and the kids in school (we took them out for the afternoon).&nbsp; 
    We even had a great crown roast of lamb instead of turkey, but we did have 
    the stuffing (courtesy of Steve), a great potatoes dauphonise (a local 
    recipe made by our friend Marc) and apple pie in a French style made by our 
    friend Beth.<p>On the paper chase front -- we've gotten 
    (just this week!) our <i>cartes de sejour</i> and the kids have gotten their <i>
    documents de circulation pour enfant mineurs</i> -- so we're now legal in 
    France, no longer <i>sans papiers </i>(without papers)!&nbsp; Just in time, 
    because we'll be leaving in three weeks to come back to the U.S. for a visit 
    at Christmas, and it might have been difficult to get back into France 
    without the official papers.&nbsp; As a funny aside: despite all the 
    involved paperwork and process, it ended up that Lisa received a <i>carte de 
    sejour</i> which allows her to work in France -- which she shouldn't really 
    be able to do.&nbsp; When we asked the clerk at the Prefecture if we were 
    understanding that right, she said, &quot;Oh, aren't you lucky?&quot;, neatly 
    dismissing the mistake -- and giving Lisa the right to work in France until 
    2007!<p>We did our first skiing of the season 
    at Alpe d'Huez, about an hour's drive away -- it was great!<p>
    If we don't do another update before the Holidays, hope you and those 
    important to you have a great holiday!
