<p align="center">INFORMATION FOR ALL FAMILIES</p>
<p align="center">Because of a strike initiated by certain unions, the 
school cafeterias will be closed on Tuesday, November 26, 2002.&nbsp; As a 
result, you should make plans to feed your children at home on that day.&nbsp; Of 
course, for those families who can not take care of their children during the 
noon meal, a cold lunch <strong>furnished by the parents</strong> may be eaten at school.</p>
