            <h1>France 2002-2003</h1>
            <p>In July, 2002, we packed up our life in suburban Seattle and decamped 
            for a year to Grenoble, France. Here are some highlights of the year and 
            our thoughts on why we did this.</p>
         <h3>Why France?</h3>
            <p>People often asked us, &quot;Why did you move to France?&quot;&nbsp; First, you have to 
            understand that France is Mike's dream, and the rest of the family went along 
            for the ride, so to speak.&nbsp; So most of the motivation for France came
            from Mike.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mike has always wanted to live for an extended period of time in 
              another country.&nbsp; Learning another language, getting a different 
              perspective on the US are a couple of the reasons.</li>
              <li>About ten years ago, Mike obtained
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_citizenship">Irish 
              citizenship</a> so that he could live and work in Europe without 
              immigration hassles.&nbsp; With European integration, his Irish 
              citizenship is equivalent to citizenship in any of the EU countries 
              (including France) for the purposes of residency and work.</li>
              <li>We all love Italy, and Italy was a strong contender.&nbsp; Kyle loves 
              Italy for the food, Lisa for the language and because it's part of her 
              heritage, and Evan for the fond memories from
              <a href="http://www.villeinitalia.com/House.jsp?name=La+Limonaia+di+Maiori">
              La Limonaia</a>, a house we rented there with some friends on the
              <a href="http://www.amalfiscoast.com/index.htm">Amalfi Coast</a> a few 
              years ago.&nbsp; But only Lisa speaks any Italian, and only a bit.&nbsp; 
              Her French is stronger, and Mike's only other language is French.&nbsp; So 
              Italy moved down the list a bit.</li>
              <li>We thought about Switzerland for a while.&nbsp; Lisa lived in
              <a href="http://www.ville-ge.ch">Geneva</a> for two years just before 
              we got married, and loved it.&nbsp; We've visited there and love the 
              mountains and the comfort of Switzerland.&nbsp; Geneva is in the 
              French-speaking part of Switzerland, so the language would work.&nbsp; 
              But, Switzerland is very expensive, and not part of the
              <a href="http://www.eurunion.org/">European Union</a>, so residence/work 
              permits would be an issue.&nbsp; When we looked on a map, we realized that 
              much of what we liked about Switzerland -- proximity to the mountains, 
              French-speaking, right size (not too big (Lisa), not too small (Mike)) was 
              available about 100 KM away -- in <a href="grenoble.htm">Grenoble</a>.</li>
              <li>As we looked more and more at Grenoble, we realized it was the right 
              place for us.</li>
              <li>But...back to why France?&nbsp; When Mike was traveling in Europe in 
              1982, he spent a couple of weeks in France.&nbsp; On October 16, 1982, he 
              wrote in a diary he kept: &quot;I love France.&nbsp; I love the food, the 
              buildings, the countryside.&nbsp; I hope someday I'll be able to return to 
              work and live here for a longer period of time.&quot;&nbsp; Twenty years later, 
              that dream was realized!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Our E-mail Updates From France</h2>
            <p>While we lived in France, we sent periodic updates by e-mail to a 
            group of friends; a sort of diary of our time in France and our thoughts 
            about what we were seeing and doing.</p>
            <p>We&#39;ve collected these on this site and you can read them by following 
            the links in the left navigation above under &quot;France&quot;</p>
