             <p class="style_bold">Fall Hikes, Adventure Parks and French Lessons</p>
             <p>I've (Lisa) got the fall hiking fever. September and October are my 
              favorite months of the year and I love being outside in the crisp autumn 
              air and with the smell of fall. After several attempts on my part to rally 
              the troops to go off on hikes in the nearby mountains were met with, &quot;no - 
              we don't want to go on another death march!,&quot; I decided that it was best 
              for all of us if I struck out on my own. Mike agreed to watch the kids for 
              a few days so I could go off and walk 'til I dropped. After agonizing over 
              which mountain range would offer the best hiking -- for me that means 
              being able to take lifts up high (as opposed to walking up!) then walking 
              in the high mountains with spectacular views, few people and no road noise 
              -- I chose <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chamonix.com">Chamonix</a>. I set off on a 
              bright Monday morning in anticipation of blue skies and drop dead gorgeous 
              mountain vistas, and found instead snow at 1300 meters, a permanent cloud 
              that hung over the valley, and no mountain vistas in sight. Drat! 
              Determined not to be discouraged, I found a place to stay and bought a 
              hiking map of the area. I stayed for 3 days and the cloud never lifted! 
              The lifts that were open go up to 1500 meters and higher and there was 
              such pea soup up above that I was afraid I wouldn't be able to see 
              one foot in front of the other, so I stayed low instead. I hiked in the 
              valley at my own pace for 3 days and was in heaven. No whining or 
              cajoling, just me and my happy feet that were willing to go for hours on 
              end. Thank you, Mike!</p>
              <p><img border="0" src="../images//OT26.jpg" align="left" width="218" height="143" />I love mountain food - all those runny cheeses and fatty meats. I 
              pretty much lived on a steady diet of ham and cheese in one form or 
              another for those 3 glorious days. For breakfast I would have <i>cafe au 
              lait</i> with bread or a croissant and a selection of cheeses. For lunch I 
              would go to one of the specialty shops that sold local meats and cheeses 
              and buy a hunk of cheese, a few slices of <i>jambon cru</i>, and a 
              baguette. For dinner (see the pattern here?!) I<img border="0" src="../images//OT25.jpg" align="right" width="218" height="143" /> would have a baked ham and 
              cheese thing with wine. By day 3 even I was getting my fill of ham and 
              cheese so that day I had escargot for lunch and mussels for dinner. Yum 
              yum!</p>
              <p>I decided to go home via Italy and explore the mountain pass between 
              Italy and France. I went from Chamonix, France to Italy via the
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atmb.net/">Mont Blanc tunnel</a> - an amazing 11 km (7 
              mile) tunnel that goes right through the mountain between France and 
              Italy. It just reopened this spring after a
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9903/26/france.tunnel.02/">horrendous accident</a> in March, 1999, where a truck caught fire and tons 
              of people were trapped in the tunnel. The tunnel turned into a mass of 
              melted cars and it took them a long time to fix it. It costs a fortune and 
              it is eerie as all get out driving through it, but I was rewarded with a 
              magnificent view of the Italian side of the Alps at the other end. Upon 
              exiting the tunnel, there was a huge glacier staring me in the face! </p>
              <p>I spent the night in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.invallee.it/">Aosta</a> - a 
              darling Italian town with some Roman ruins still standing in the old part 
              of the city. I decided to buy some Italian essentials before returning to 
              France the next day. I spent the afternoon browsing through pasta shops, 
              buying unlabeled and unfiltered olive oil, and stocking up on a few 
              staples like polenta, balsamic vinegar, dried funghi, parmesan cheese, and 
              Italian bread sticks. Then I strolled through the ruins soaking up their 
              beauty. I had had a light lunch and was ready for dinner - at 6:00! 
              Mama mia! In Italy, as in much of Europe, this is way too early. I scoped out a 
              bunch of restaurants and my tummy growled a little louder when I saw that 
              they opened between 7:30 and 8 pm. This was my only meal in Italy, so I 
              wanted to make it a good one. I was tempted by one restaurant that was 
              open at 6:30 - menu in English, tourists inside, EATING! You know the kind 
              of place I'm talking about. I started to open the door, then thought, &quot;No!&nbsp; 
              I can do better than this.&quot; So I toured the old town for another hour and 
              picked my restaurant. The menu was handwritten and I was able to pick out 
              a few key words like <i>gnocchetti, calamari</i>, and <i>funghi</i>. That looked pretty 
              promising, so in I went. What a great choice! I started with a selection 
              of antipasti that I still dream about at night, followed by some homemade 
              little gnocchi with a sauce like grandma used to make. I also randomly 
              chose a half bottle of wine (pretty label!) and savored that as well. I 
              didn't see any prices and was a little wary of what the check might look 
              like - especially the wine. The grand total - about $20. The wine was a 
              whopping $6! If I'd had my wits about me, I would have bought a case. Oh 
              well, it's not like there's a lack of good wine in our lives here.</p>
              <p>The next day I set off for home. Get this - bright blue skies, blazing 
              sunshine, and finally, the mountain views in all their splendor! Ah well - 
              there's always next year. It's times like these when I'm glad we are here 
              for a year. If I miss something the first time around, I know there is 
              time for another shot. I drove home via
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comune.torino.it/">Torino</a>, then up into the 
              mountains. There was hardly anyone on the road (thankfully!) so i was able 
              to enjoy the views and drive the curvy roads at my own pace without 
              someone behind me almost touching my bumper and flashing their lights like 
              it is a national emergency that I get the hell out of their way! Shortly 
              after I crossed the border I drove by
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.briancon.com/index1.htm">Brian<font face="Trebuchet MS">ç</font>on</a> 
              - a small town with a huge fortress built on a hill. I made a mental note 
              to bring the boys back there sometime soon. I picked up some hitch hikers 
              with climbing gear - two men and a woman. They were so thrilled that I 
              stopped because they hadn't realized that their climbing route had taken 
              them so far from their car and they needed to be back in Grenoble soon. 
              When I dropped them off the man told me that he and his wife owned and 
              restaurant in Grenoble and invited me to bring my family and have dinner 
              on them! Pretty cool. It was hard to come back to the city at rush hour, 
              but it was great to see Mike and the kids and know that I still have my 
              little mountain vista by our breakfast nook and within minutes I can be 
              back in the mountains.</p>

              <img border="2" src="../images//Climbing_small.JPG" align="left" xthumbnail-orig-image="Climbing.JPG" width="100" height="98" /></a>Speaking 
              of mountains, the kids and I have been frequenting the &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aventure-parc.fr/">adventure 
              parks</a>&quot; here. They are like a mini-Outward Bound center with ropes 
              obstacle courses high up in the trees, trampolines where you are attached 
              to giant-sized rubber bands, and sometimes wild luge runs down the 
              mountains! We're hooked. Last week we ran into a tough course and didn't 
              get past the kid's course. I still have black and blues from the Tarzan 
              swing! We had to swing into a hanging cargo net, then climb up the net, 
              reattach our secure lines, and scramble onto a platform in the trees. I 
              pulled myself high on the rope thinking that this way I would hit the net 
              at a high place and wouldn't have to climb too far up the net, then 
              swung and promptly released my bent arms (too much gravity there!) and 
              fell low into the net. I frantically grabbed at it so I wouldn't swing 
              back to the starting point and end up in never-never land. It was quite a

              sight! Not terribly graceful, but I was then able to move to some of the 
              more fun stuff like the zip wire. The boys pretended that they were in 
              basic training and had a blast (except for the retched cargo net!). They 
              each did the long zip wire 3 times and screamed the whole way down. When 
              we finished the &quot;kid course&quot; I asked if they were ready to move on to the 
              adult course and they both said, to my relief, that they'd had enough!

              <h3>Mariuccia Visits</h2>
              <p>Okay, so I'm not grocery shopping with a Gucci evening gown and heels, 
              and compared to many French women on the street I look like the queen o' 
              frump, but damn, am I having fun in the mountains!</p>
              <p>My Italian aunt Mariuccia is visting for 2 weeks. She's a hoot and the 
              easiest and most pleasant guest in the world. She cooks great food and 
              then insists on cleaning up afterward. She won't allow Mike in the kitchen 
              despite his half hearted attempts to help her (yeah, right Mike!) She's 
              been <a href="../images//Mariuccia%20in%20Grenoble.JPG"> 
              <img border="2" src="../images//Mariuccia%20in%20Grenoble_small.JPG" align="left" xthumbnail-orig-image="Mariuccia in Grenoble.JPG" width="100" height="96"></a>making seafood risotto, gnocchi, polenta with sausages, and other 
              treats. She doesn't speak a word of English or French but manages to 
              communicate with everyone. I've been with her often enough that I don't 
              even try to translate for her because she says it is too much work for me 
              and she can manage well enough on her own. The gal is 78! She has also 
              been beading with me every afternoon and my stock of jewels is growing.&nbsp; 
              She's no speed demon - she is blind in one eye and only 70% in the other, 
              but she is having a blast!</p>
              <a name="cima">La Cima</a>
              <p>She has made friends all throughout our neighborhood! The butcher loves 
              her and although he speaks no Italian, they do fine. One day she was 
              trying to explain a certain cut of meat she wanted. It was a stomach 
              lining or something scary like that and she had a special dish she wanted 
              to make with it. She went on and on trying to explain what it was (I was 
              offering no help here, hoping that indeed such a disgusting thing didn't 
              exist in France) and soon she had the 3 people working there, along with 
              several customers, trying to problem solve for her! After about 10 
              minutes, she gave up and we bought some mundane pork chops and moved on. 
              Our next stop was a new Italian take out store called Pronto a la Tavola. 
              This is just up the street from our butcher and had just opened this week. 
              This time she starts telling the owner about her search for &quot;la cima&quot; and 
              he says, oh si, si - there is a very good butcher across the street - just 
              ask him and he'll have it for you. I'm cracking up by now, and another 
              customer in this store who had followed us from the butcher's began 
              discussing the whole problem in French with the (bilingual) owner. What a 
              drama! Finally, the woman looks at me and says, &quot;Oh yes, he has what she 
              is looking for.&quot; I smiled weakly and tried to distract my aunt with the 
              various delicacies in the food case. Although she seems to have given up 
              on la cima project, it has made us great friends with the butcher and the 
              Italian store owner. Oh yeah, we also discovered that the owners of our 
              local <i>frutier</i> (fruit and veggie shop across the street) are both Italians 
              and she is on a first&nbsp; name basis with them too. On my way to take 
              Evan to circus school the other day I got a hearty &quot;<i><b>buon giorno</b></i>&quot; from the 
              Italian. Evan asked me who he was, and I just told him that it was a long 
              story! The long shot is that I think I will have to lock Mariuccia up here 
              so she can't go back home. Plan B is to have her come back for 
              Thanksgiving when Jody and Steve, and hopefully Jody's folks, Jack and 
              LaRita, are coming.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Aunt Mo and baby Lia will be here in a week 
              and we can't wait!</p>
              <p>I can't say that my French is improving much, but my Italian is 
              certainly getting better! That's it for now from me. As always, we love getting 
              news from our friends. </p>
