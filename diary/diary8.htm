    <h2>May 2003</h2>
    <p>Lisa here...</p>
    <p>As I write this, on Wednesday April 30, we're on the A12 autoroute, heading north 
    along the Italian coast from 
    <a href="http://www.emmeti.it/Welcome/Liguria/RivieraTigullio/SantaMargherita/index.uk.html">Santa Marguerita Ligure</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.comune.portofino.genova.it/English/sorgente.asp?bodytext=mappa.asp&menu=mappa">Portofino</a>, through 
    Genoa, then home to Grenoble.&nbsp; We've been on the road for 12 days 
    taking advantage of the kid's two week Easter break.&nbsp; All in all, it's 
    been a pretty good trip. The thing I learned the most is that we are still 
    faced with many challenges in perfecting the art of traveling as a family. 
    Twelve days is a lot of togetherness! </p>
    <p>We snuck the kids out of school early on Friday afternoon, 
    April 18, and headed south on a beautiful sunny day to the C<font face="Trebuchet MS">ô</font>te 
    d'Azur -- the French Rivieria.&nbsp; Mike's friends, Jonathan Day and Melissa Taylor, own 
    a beautiful villa above Cannes, <i><span lang="fr">
    <a href="http://www.calamuse.com">La Calamuse</a></span>,</i> and invited us 
    to spend the weekend with them. They were even more generous when they let 
    us stay on for a few days after they left to return to their home in London. 
    The kids swam in the heated pool, had squirt gun fights, and explored the 
    property with flashlights after dark. The adults shopped in the local 
    market, ate fabulous food, drank good wines, and explored the nearby towns. 
    We were there about three weeks before the
    <a href="http://www.festival-cannes.fr/default1.php">film festival</a> but 
    Cannes was hopping. One day Mike and I decided to take a leisurely drive 
    along the coast from Cannes to Antibes with the boys. We only realized what 
    a mistake we had made when we found ourselves in a quagmire of traffic that 
    inched along at a snail's pace. After ingesting car fumes and avoiding 
    zooming <i>motos</i> (scooters), we gave up and opted for the inland road 
    back to the quiet of the villa. Neither of us could imagine what the coast 
    must be like in the summer when half of France migrates south for the month 
    of August. Crowds, hot weather, and traffic jams are three of the things 
    that I hate most in life - it was clear that we weren't heading back here 
    for a while. </p>
    <p>We left the next day and headed to an adventure park in the 
    area where the boys spent 3 hours up in the trees doing a challenging ropes 
    course complete with a big zip wire at the end. They were tired, sweaty, and 
    full of stories of their adventures as we drove across the border into 
    Italy. We made an overnight stop in San Remo to soak up some sun, stroll 
    along the boardwalk, and eat the first of many plates of fresh, hot,
    <span lang="it"><i>calamari fritti</i></span>. We were in heaven! We moved 
    onto Savona where my Aunt Mariuccia lives. We spent 4 days - she having 
    convinced us to extend our stay by one day because there simply was not 
    enough time for us to eat all the meals she had planned for us! We 
    capitulated (tough as it was) and ate everything from the infamous &quot;cima&quot; (<a href="diary4.htm#cima">full 
    details</a>), la farinata, more fresh seafood, almond paste pignoli cookies, 
    and daily doses of gelato.</p>
    <p>I should say that the adults loved the food-centered nature 
    of the visit, but the kids were less enthused - one in particular.&nbsp; 
    Evan, who hates eating in restaurants, finally lost it on the second day 
    when I told him that we were going out to eat again for lunch. You know that 
    feeling you get when you have to tell your child something that you know 
    he'll absolutely hate...and then you brace yourself for the reaction?&nbsp; 
    Well, this was one of those times. After gingerly telling him that we were 
    going out to eat again for lunch, Evan looked at me with a &quot;you wouldn't 
    really do this to me&quot; expression, then, seeing that I was serious, let out a 
    long moan/scream and shouted, &quot;I hate this whole stupid country and all 
    their stupid food and restaurants! You can't make me go - I'M NOT GOOOOOING!&quot; 
    Poor bubby. We got him into the car and listened to the injustice of his 
    having to go to yet another (fabulous) Italian restaurant all the way - by 
    the time we got there, he had pulled himself together and survived the meal 
    by working on his Jump Start reading&nbsp; workbook between courses. Good 
    food...homework... go figure.</p>
    <p>We said our goodbyes to Mariuccia and stuffed our well-fed 
    bodies into the car and headed down the coast to the Portofino peninsula. We 
    had sunshine, great ocean views, and non-restaurant meals. Mike got a few 
    opportunities to sip cappuccino and contemplate his one year anniversary of 
    retirement from Microsoft. Everyone was much happier here. A big part of the 
    peninsula is a national park with lots of gorgeous hiking trails. We all did 
    a bit of hiking, and Kyle and I did a few long, hilly hikes to test out our 
    interest and preparedness for the Tour of Mount Blanc that we are hoping to 
    do this summer. Kyle was a trooper and hiked his little legs off with no 
    complaining - Mt. Blanc, here we come!</p>
    <p>We started a new tradition of doing crossword puzzles from 
    the International Herald Tribune together as a family. One day, we actually 
    completed the entire puzzle! When we tried the next day's puzzle and failed 
    miserably, Mike was convinced that they had some lackey prepare the 
    crossword puzzle that we were able to do and that the real puzzle guy must 
    have been on vacation that day! </p>
    <p>As we talk about summer travel plans, we're all a little 
    daunted by the prospect of yet another period of intense &quot;togetherness.&quot;&nbsp; 
    But deep down, I think, I hope, that we will find it to be another 
    opportunity to learn more about each other, hone our compromise abilities, 
    and continue to build a lifetime of shared experiences as a family.</p>
    <p>Today, we're back to Grenoble for really just a few more weeks of 
    school -- the kids finish on June 28,&nbsp; and between now and then, they 
    have no fewer than three holidays!&nbsp; <i>(see below)</i></p>
    <h3>March and April</h3>
      <p>Since our last update, we've had some visitors!
        <p>Our friends from 
        Iceland, Siggi and Thora, and their kids, Sindri and Snorri, visited 
        for a week in early March.&nbsp; We did some skiing in spring conditions 
        -- which means warm sunshine, but less than perfect snow -- and an 
        excursion south to Provence and the
        <a href="http://www.saintes-maries.camargue.fr/">Carmargue</a>, a pretty 
        unique region in France that includes a large migratory bird sanctuary 
        and real French cowboys.
        <p>Mike's dad, Maurice (who is 84) and his brother, Bill, 
        along with his daughter, Allison, visited for a week in early April.&nbsp; 
        They ended the trip in Paris -- Bill's first visit to the city!
      <p>Distribution of Lisa's jewelry is continuing to grow -- 
      she's now in 13 stores in France!&nbsp; She and our friend, Yvette, hosted 
      a Princess Party for moms and daughters to make 
      Princess-themed bead creations on April 12.
      <p>Mike is writing an article for MSDN Magazine on the new 
      version of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/default.asp">
      Office</a>.&nbsp; He's also will have an <a href="i_hate_cnn.htm">essay</a> 
      published in the Seattle Times this Sunday (May 4).
      <p>Our friends, Marc and Beth, welcomed a new daughter,
      Julia, on March 25, just two days after we 
      had a really fun shower
    <h3>May</h3>
      <p>Today, May 1, is Labor Day just about everywhere in the 
      world except the United States.&nbsp; The U.S. established a separate 
      Labor Day in September because of the Communist overtones of May Day.&nbsp; 
      We were treated to loud demonstrations today outside our apartment by the 
      French labor movement upset at the government plans to change retirement 
      rules and benefits.&nbsp; More on the history of Labor Day and May Day
      <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/question459.htm">here.</a>
      <p>Lisa's continuing to do weekly bead parties on Tuesdays 
      and also has a special &quot;Mother's Day Gift Making&quot; party planned for May 17 
      (French Mother's Day is 2 weeks after the U.S. Mother's Day).
      <p>We're expecting two of Mike's friends in May: Maya Porter, 
      will be here on May 9-12, and Gary Rivlin will be here May 16-26.&nbsp; 
      We're heading down to the Mediterranean coast again at the end of May with 
      our friends, Marc and Beth, to visit Marc's parents in
      <a href="http://www.provenceweb.fr/f/var/carqueir/carqueir.htm">
      Carqueiranne</a>.
      <p>Our trip to Carqueiranne will be during the kids' second 
      holiday in May, commemorating<i> l'Ascencion.&nbsp; </i>This is the
      <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01767b.htm">Feast of the 
      Ascension</a>, the fortieth day after Easter, believed by Christians to be 
      the day Christ ascended into heaven.&nbsp; By the way, the fact that this 
      is a national holiday says a lot about what a Catholic country France is -- in theory anyway.&nbsp; The other two 
      school holidays the kids have coming are May 8 (just three days after they
      <i>return</i> to school on May 5!) which is the day France was liberated 
      in WWII and June 9 (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15614b.htm">Whit 
      Monday</a>).&nbsp; Whit Monday comes after Whit Sunday, which is called 
      Pentecost Sunday in English.&nbsp; But because it's a Sunday and the 
      French are already off work on Sunday, they need to celebrate the day 
      after as well! This brings us to a great French term and tradition: <i>
      faire le pont</i>, which means &quot;bridging the gap.&quot;&nbsp; It's used when a 
      holiday falls mid-week.&nbsp; Many French decide to go ahead and extend it 
      through the following weekend, creating a three- or four-day weekend.&nbsp; 
      This often results in a &quot;<i>Jour Rouge</i>&quot; (Red Day) for the French 
      traffic forecasts.&nbsp; Yes, we have Red Alerts in France, too, but 
      they're for traffic, not for terrorism -- except that some would consider 
      French drivers trying desperately to get out of Paris or Lyon for their 
      holidays terrorists in their own right. 
    <h3>June</h3>
      <p>Looking ahead to next month, we're welcoming more 
      visitors!&nbsp; (Better sign up now!).
      <p>Our friends, Mike Loftin and Sue Matteucci, with their 
      sons, Ben and George, will arrive around June 15.
      <p>We're <i>hoping</i> to be seeing Mike's cousins, Larry and 
      Dan, although we haven't heard from them for a while (<i>hint hint...</i>)
      <p>June 10 will be Kyle's eleventh birthday!!
      <p>Kyle is going with his school class to
      La Grande Motte, a camp on the 
      Mediterranean (we really like the Mediterranean...) for an eight-day <i>
      classe de la mer</i> (class on the sea) in mid-June.

    <p>Hope all's well with you!</p>
